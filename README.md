# dotfiles

My environment configurations.

## Motivation

What started as a collection of application configuration files has morphed into a set of scripts for turning a clean machine into a customized software development environment.

## How it works

Start with

```
sh install.sh
```

then, move to

```
sh setup.sh
```
